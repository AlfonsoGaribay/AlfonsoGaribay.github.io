## The Idea

At the time I wanted a simple page where I could send people — something like a Linktree, but my own version of it. Just a clean place with a few important links and a bit of personality.

The functional part of the project was straightforward. A small page, a profile image, and a handful of links to the places that mattered.

What made it interesting to me was the visual side.

I had recently come across Vanta.js and thought the animated effects looked really cool. Instead of just a static page, I wanted something that had a bit of movement to it.

## The Inspiration

The background image on the page comes from Murcia, Spain — one of the prettiest cities I’ve had the chance to visit.

I liked the idea of combining something personal like that with a small web experiment. A nice photo as the base layer, and then the Vanta birds animation moving across the screen.

It adds just enough motion to make the page feel alive without getting in the way of the actual content.

## The Build

Technically the project is very simple.

It’s built with:

- Vanilla HTML  
- CSS for layout and styling  
- A bit of JavaScript to initialize Vanta.js

The structure is minimal on purpose. A centered layout, profile image, and a list of links.

Most of the experimentation went into figuring out how to layer the animation properly over the background image while keeping the text readable.

Things like blur, transparency, and spacing ended up doing a lot of the work.

## What I Took Away From It

Projects like this are small, but they’re useful.

They’re a good excuse to try a library you haven’t used before, see how it behaves, and understand where it fits.

Vanta.js in particular was fun to experiment with. It’s surprisingly easy to integrate, and it can add a lot visually with very little code.

At the same time it’s a reminder that even simple pages benefit from a bit of thought around layout and presentation.

## Closing Thoughts

This isn’t meant to be a massive project.

It’s just a small experiment that turned into a personal link page, and a chance to play around with animation on the web.

Sometimes that’s all a project needs to be.
