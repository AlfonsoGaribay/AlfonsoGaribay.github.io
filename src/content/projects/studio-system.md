Studio System is an internal framework for building marketing pages, case studies, and lightweight content surfaces with a consistent visual language. The goal is speed without flattening everything into the same template.

The system is organized around reusable layout primitives, type scales, and card patterns that can be recombined while preserving tone. It is less about strict components and more about a repeatable rhythm for shipping.

A lot of the value comes from constraints: fewer one-off decisions, more attention on what the page is trying to say.
