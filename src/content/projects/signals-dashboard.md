Signals Dashboard explores a more editorial approach to analytics. Instead of overwhelming the viewer with every metric, it highlights the handful of signals that matter most in the current moment.

The concept pairs metrics with short narrative annotations so trends are immediately legible. This makes the dashboard useful for both makers and stakeholders who want context, not just charts.

It is an ongoing experiment in balancing clarity, speed, and storytelling in data-heavy interfaces.
