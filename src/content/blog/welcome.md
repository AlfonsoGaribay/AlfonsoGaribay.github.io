## Introduction

I’ve been thinking for a while about what my personal site should actually be.

A lot of sites like this turn into a résumé page with a few links and maybe a portfolio grid. That’s useful, but it never really felt like enough for me.

I wanted something that showed a little more of who I am.

Not just what I’ve done, but what I’m trying to figure out.

So this site is partly a place to write, partly a place to share things I’ve built, and maybe — in a quiet way — a place to show people what I’m capable of.

## The reality after college

Like a lot of people coming out of school, I thought the path forward would be a little clearer than it turned out to be.

The tech world moves fast. The job market changes. Entire categories of work appear and disappear almost overnight.

For a while that was honestly a bit disorienting.

But it also forced me to keep learning.

Most of my time outside of work is still spent doing that. Lately that’s meant digging into AI tools, things like Codex, OpenClaw, prompt design, and generally trying to understand where things are heading.

Part curiosity.  
Part survival.  
Part excitement.

I don’t always know where it leads, but I like being close to the edge of what’s happening.

## Why this site exists

This site is meant to be a little window into that process.

Sometimes it’ll just be thoughts like this.

Other times I’ll post something I designed or built — maybe a small project, maybe just an idea that seemed interesting enough to share.

I don’t expect everything here to be perfect.

In fact, part of the point is showing the work while it’s still a little unfinished.

Because that’s usually when it’s the most honest.

## The thing behind all of this

Behind most of what I’m doing is something called **Bosque Studio**.

It’s been a sort of long-running project of mine since college.

Bosque isn’t fully formed yet. It’s still evolving. But the idea behind it has stayed pretty consistent.

I want to build things that help people get started.

Sometimes that means helping a small team improve their website.  
Sometimes it means helping someone with almost no technical background get their idea online.

There’s something really satisfying about taking something that only exists in someone’s head and turning it into something real.

A website.  
A product.  
A brand.

Even if it starts small.

## Showing more than qualifications

One thing I’ve realized is that a list of skills doesn’t really say much about someone.

You can write “designer” or “developer” on a page, but that doesn’t show how someone thinks.

This site is an attempt to show that side of things.

How I approach problems.  
What I’m curious about.  
What I’m learning.

If someone visits — whether it’s a recruiter, someone looking for help, or just a random person on the internet — I’d rather they leave with a clearer picture of who I am than just a bullet list of technologies.

## Closing thoughts

I’m still figuring things out.

The industry is changing quickly, and I’m doing my best to keep up while also building something meaningful along the way.

This site is part of that.

A place to document the process, share ideas, and occasionally show the work behind **Bosque Studio**.

If nothing else, it’s a small record of what I’m trying to build and why it matters to me.
