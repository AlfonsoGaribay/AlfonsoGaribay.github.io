## Introduction

There’s something I’ve been building in the background for a long time.

It’s called **Bosque Studio**.

It’s not exactly a company.  
Not really an agency either.

It’s more like a place where the things I care about — design, building things on the web, and helping people shape their ideas — can live together.

I’ve been working on it in small pieces since college, mostly outside of work hours, and in many ways it’s become my ongoing experiment.

## Where it started

I studied computer engineering.

A lot of my time was spent understanding systems, writing code, and figuring out how things worked under the hood.

But somewhere along the way I realized something.

What interested me just as much — maybe more — was **how technology felt to use**.

The interface.  
The structure of a website.  
The small decisions that make something intuitive or frustrating.

I didn’t want to just build software.

I wanted to shape the experience around it.

Bosque slowly became the container for that curiosity.

## Why “Bosque”

Bosque means **forest**.

I’ve always liked the metaphor.

Forests grow slowly. Quietly. Over time.

There’s no big launch moment.  
Things develop layer by layer.

That felt closer to how real projects actually evolve.

Bosque wasn’t something I expected to explode overnight.  
It was something I wanted to grow steadily.

## Building something outside of work

Most of Bosque has been built in the margins of normal life.

Early mornings.  
Late evenings.  
Random weekends where I had the energy to sit down and push something forward.

That pace can feel slow sometimes.

But it also means every part of it exists because I genuinely wanted to work on it.

No one assigned it to me.  
No one was expecting updates.

It’s just something I keep coming back to.

## What Bosque actually is right now

Right now Bosque is a mix of a few things.

Design work.  
Small websites.  
Experiments in branding and UI.  
Ideas that may or may not become something real.

Some projects start in Figma.  
Some become actual websites.  
Some stay as concepts.

And honestly, that’s okay.

I’m less interested in forcing it into a strict business model and more interested in letting it develop into something useful.

Ideally it becomes a place where I can help small teams, local businesses, and interesting people build better things on the web.

## What I’ve learned from it

Working on Bosque has pushed me to learn things I probably wouldn’t have otherwise.

How to think about design systems.  
How spacing and typography actually change how something feels.  
How small details add up.

Lately that’s meant experimenting with tools like **Astro, Tailwind, and Figma**, and trying to keep things simple rather than over-engineering everything.

Not everything works.

But the process of figuring it out has been valuable on its own.

## Where it might go

I’m not entirely sure what Bosque becomes.

Maybe it grows into a small studio.  
Maybe it stays a personal project that occasionally turns into real work.

For now, it’s just something I care about enough to keep showing up for.

And honestly, that feels like a good place to start.
