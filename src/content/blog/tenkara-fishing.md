Tenkara fishing strips things down to the essentials: a rod, line, fly, and good water. That simplicity is exactly what makes it so satisfying.

I have been drawn to tenkara because it rewards patience and observation more than gear. You pay closer attention to the current seams, small rises, and the way a drift changes with just a little line angle.

It also feels like a good counterweight to screen-heavy work. A short session on a creek can reset the day, even if I do not land much.

More than anything, tenkara reminds me that a lot of joy lives in simple systems done well.
